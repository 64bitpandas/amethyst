Folder Structure # Here&amp;rsquo;s a rough overview of what&amp;rsquo;s what.
All notes you want to publish should go in the /content folder. To make edits, you can open any of the files and make changes directly and save it. You can organize content into any subfolder you&amp;rsquo;d like.
To edit the main home page, open /content/_index.</description></item><item><title>Obsidian Vault Integration</title><link>https://amethyst.bencuan.me/setup/obsidian/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amethyst.bencuan.me/setup/obsidian/</guid><description>Setup # Obsidian is the preferred way to use Amethyst.
